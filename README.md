# Darcula Plus VS Code Theme

<!-- ## About -->

The theme is not a classic Darcula, because it is based on [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) theme, so it has some differences. You may like it.

## Development

1. `yarn` or `npm i`
1. `yarn watch` or `npm watch`
1. press `F5` and you will see VS Code Theme
1. Now you can make changes in `src/theme.js`. Live server will watch for file changes and recompile `themes/Darcula Plus.json` which is used for applying theme in VS Code
